print(object(s), sep=' ', end='\n', file=file, flush=False)

"""
MEANING OF THE ABOVE STATEMENT

object(s) are the values to be printed on the screen. They are converted to strings before getting printed.

sep keyword is used to specify how to separate the objects inside the same print statement. By default, we have it as sep=' ', a space between two objects.

end is used to print a particular thing after all the values are printed. By default, we have end as \n, which provides a new line after each print() statement.

file is used to specify where to display the output. By default, it is sys.stdout (which is the screen).
flush specifies the boolean expression if the output is False or True. By default, it is False. In Python, the output from the print() goes into a buffer. Using the flush= True parameter helps in flushing the buffer as soon as we use the print() statement.
